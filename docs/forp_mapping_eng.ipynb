    "# Integration of the Arduino Solution into the MEG Information System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the **Arduino-based solution** developed to modernize communication between the stimulation computer and the MEG system.  \n",
    "This solution replaces the legacy parallel port with a reliable **serialâ€“TTL interface**, providing both **precise trigger generation** and **real-time supervision** of the signals exchanged in the MEG room.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates the role of the **Arduino Mega 2560** board within the current information system:  \n",
    "**[`Wiring diagram with the Arduino solution`](Schematic_Stim-MEG.png)**\n",
    "\n",
    "It acts as a **communication interface** between the **stimulation PC (PC stim)** and the **experimental devices** (FORP response box and, optionally, a photodiode or other components depending on future extensions), while simultaneously forwarding the same information to the **MEG acquisition PC**.  \n",
    "This ensures **millisecond-level synchronization** between stimulus/response events and MEG signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key role of the Arduino in the MEG room:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Arduino board provides **direct control and visibility** over what happens inside the MEG room, acting as a **real-time feedback interface** for stimulus and response events.  \n",
    "It also generates the **TTL triggers** that allow precise monitoring of the **actual image display** on the stimulation screen, ensuring consistency between the software trigger and the effective visual onset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”Œ FORP Wiring Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The first eight digital output lines (D22â€“D29) of the Arduino Mega are assigned to control the **TTL signals** of the **STI box**, corresponding to the eight buttons of the **FORP response box**.  \n",
    "The following table summarizes this mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Line | Arduino Pin | STI Signal | Function / FORP Button |\n",
    "|:------|:-------------|:------------|:------------------------|\n",
    "| 0 | 22 | STI007 | Left blue |\n",
    "| 1 | 23 | STI008 | Left yellow |\n",
    "| 2 | 24 | STI009 | Left green |\n",
    "| 3 | 25 | STI010 | Left red |\n",
    "| 4 | 26 | STI012 | Right blue |\n",
    "| 5 | 27 | STI013 | Right yellow |\n",
    "| 6 | 28 | STI014 | Right green |\n",
    "| 7 | 29 | STI015 | Right red |\n",

    "## âš¡ Experimental Trigger Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pins **D30â€“D37** are dedicated to the **generation of TTL triggers**, sent during experimental events (stimulus onset, condition coding, response detection, etc.).  \n",
    "Each line can be independently activated using a **binary mask** sent by the stimulation PC over the serial port.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism allows:\n",
    "- encoding of up to **8 bits of information simultaneously**,  \n",
    "- **configurable pulse width** depending on experimental needs,  \n",
    "- and **combinations of multiple triggers** to represent complex conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup ensures that the Arduino reproduces the **exact stimulus timeline** as displayed on the screen, validated through the integrated **photodiode** monitoring device.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arduinoâ€“STI Mapping Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows the connections between the Arduino digital outputs and the **STI box** inputs:  \n",
    "**[`Arduino and STI box mapping`](schematic_forp_mapping.png)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extensibility of the Arduino Board\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the currently used pins D22â€“D37:\n",
    "- several **additional digital pins** remain available to **add new peripherals** (sensors, extra photodiodes, display modules, etc.),  \n",
    "- the firmware has been designed to be **easily extendable**, allowing new commands to be added without modifying the existing wiring,  \n",
    "- this architecture makes the solution **modular** and adaptable to a wide variety of experimental protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’¡ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Arduino Mega serves as a **bidirectional interface** between the **stimulation PC**, the **FORP response box**, and the **MEG system**.  \n",
    "- It provides **real-time feedback** on experimental activity while ensuring **synchronized trigger generation**.  \n",
    "- Pins D22â€“D29 handle **FORP button signals**, pins D30â€“D37 generate **stimulus triggers**, and other pins remain available for **future extensions**.\n"
